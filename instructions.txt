flutter pub add provider
flutter pub add uuid

when having a provide we have several methods to interact with provider
context.read<T>() // Like a snapshot, use it for one way communication, 
onCallbacks use like onTap events, etc

context.select((value)=> null)// allows you to watch specific changes inside your provider. 
only works inside build, 

context.watch, watching for changes in our provider, also optional providers

Consumer is like a building block that will rebuild your widget when changes happen
child within consumer, is a widget that will survive changes to our provider
